# ES-Second-Common-Era
Coming eventually

## What is this?
ES Second Common Era is (going to be) a plugin for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) that takes place thousands of years after the events of the vanilla game.
The player is no longer a human, but an individual of a new race of aliens that has only recently discovered the secrets to space travel. For players who are familiar with the vanill game, things in the Milky Way will feel very different.
The map of this 2nd CE Milky Way will use all the same systems as the vanilla game, as well as the systems of a few big plugins (Shields Up, Enigma Corp, Adamas Project, and The Eternals). Other than the positions being the same (and the contents of the systems being mostly the same), names and links will be all changed.

## State of this 2nd CE Milky Way
Now this part will be spoilers as to the situation of all the races in the Milky Way. Read at your own risk if you don't want to be spoiled when playing the actual story.

* **Humans**: Being given thousands of years to advance as a species, Humanity has reached Tier 2 status. They have also followed in the footsteps of the Hai, trading territory for stability. Human territory now consists of a long strip of systems in the 1st CE Far North along with a few old Hai systems.
* **Hai**: The Hai, somewhat sadly (depending on who you ask), have gone extinct. How exactly this happened is unknown to the player, but the Humans speak of some sort of Great War that ended in terrible destruction.
* **Korath**: The Korath have returned to greatness and have rebuilt their society, managing to reach Tier 2.5 status in the mean time. As such, the Drak have destroyed the nano-bots as there is no longer a need to keep them around in order to remember the Korath by.
* **Coalition**: Given that we know little of the Coalition right now, I am not sure where they will come into play in this new age.
* **Quarg and Drak**: The Quarg and the Drak are the same as always. Quarg ringworlds will all be in the same place and the Drak will still be hanging around, enforcing their silly laws.
* **Pug and Wanderers**: As far as can be seen to the player and to the species that the player may encounter, the Pug have not been seen in the Milky Way for over 10 millennia. But interestingly, the Wanderers are still in the Milky Way, although their society is in shambles and they are hanging on to survive. The worlds that the Wanderers are watching over have been healed for hundreds upon hundreds of years, but the Eye has not opened, leading to hysteria among the Wanderers.

## But who is the player?
The player is a member of an alien race known as the Gnuins. This race has only been a multi-system species for 218 years, and their current calendar starts on the day of their first hyperdrive activation.
The Gnuins are a tribalistic society divided into houses. You are a member of one of the greatest houses, and as such receive many privileges. 
You have just become old enough to go out into the galaxy on your own, and as such your father has gifted you with his very first ship, allowing you to go out into Gnuinian society and bring your house even more glory.

## When will you be working on this?
Much, much later. I expect this to be the very last thing I do for Endless Sky. Right now I have [Shields Up]() and [Enigma Corp]() on my hands to work on. Both of which are going to have stories as big as and even bigger than the campaigns in the vanilla game, meaning that they will take a loooong time to complete. And doing this will essentially be creating a whole new Endless Sky, with all new story and new lore. Doing something that big means that it might take just as long as the Endless Sky story and lore is taking. Given that, I will obviously be inviting others to work with me and even create their own plugins for my plugin that might get added into this plugin. That might sound like a lot of plugins, but it's really just a second Endless Sky. :)
